# esv_bible_qa


## TODO:

- Modify scraping script to iterate across pages of the website
    - this can be done using the list of short name book mapping and inserting into url.  must lowercase

- Modify parsing script to iterate all html docs when they are written.
    - Probably use glob?  or just use the same short name book mapping script


- Scrape ESV version from bible gateway one verse at a time

- Add both of these datasets together




## DONE:

Created scraping script using selenium
Created parsing script using beautifulsoup
